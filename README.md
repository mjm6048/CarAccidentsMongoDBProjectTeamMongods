# Stack
    We use node_app for the purpose of the frontend. It was easier to implement for the frontend display.

# Process
    We loaded data of where the accidents are and the weather condidtion at that specific time as well as the description. There was some trouble with the loaded image. But now it is fixed which can display the weather image.
